My first project in Foundations named Recipes 

Very easy yet educational project I did that showed me the very basics of website structure with html.
This project also helped me figure out the basics of using Git and Github. I am still a little confused with it at the moment but I feel the more I practice the better i will get.

I also got to practice all that ive learned from Foundations thus far including, boilerplate's, heading, paragraphs, alternative texts, links, images, unordered, and ordered lists.

I really look forward to the challenges and knowledge i will acquire as I keep progressing through the Foundations lessons.
